## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore and run the code:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhinn05/DSA.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd DSA
   ```

3. **Compile and Run C++ Files**:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```

   Replace `filename.cpp` with the desired file name.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
- **IDE/Text Editor**: Use any code editor of your choice (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).
